# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for a Django-based authentication and authorization system that will serve as the foundation for a multi-user asset tracker application. The system enables user registration, login, and role-based permission management to control access to asset tracking functionality.

## Glossary

- **Authentication System**: The Django application component responsible for verifying user identity
- **User**: An individual with credentials who can access the system
- **Permission**: A specific authorization that grants access to perform an action
- **Role**: A collection of permissions assigned to users
- **Session**: An authenticated period during which a user interacts with the system
- **Admin User**: A user with elevated privileges to manage other users and permissions

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to create new user accounts with assigned roles, so that I can onboard users to the asset tracker system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin user submits a user creation form with username, email, password, and role THEN the Authentication System SHALL create a new user account with the specified credentials and role
2. WHEN an admin user attempts to create a user with an existing username THEN the Authentication System SHALL reject the creation and display an error message
3. WHEN an admin user creates a user account THEN the Authentication System SHALL hash the password before storing it in the database
4. WHEN an admin user submits an invalid email format THEN the Authentication System SHALL reject the user creation and display a validation error
5. WHEN a non-admin user attempts to create user accounts THEN the Authentication System SHALL deny access and return an authorization error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to log in with my credentials, so that I can access my account and use the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits valid credentials THEN the Authentication System SHALL create an authenticated session and redirect to the dashboard
2. WHEN a user submits invalid credentials THEN the Authentication System SHALL reject the login attempt and display an error message
3. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the Authentication System SHALL store session data to maintain authentication state
4. WHEN an authenticated user closes their browser and returns THEN the Authentication System SHALL maintain the session if it has not expired
5. WHEN a session exceeds the configured timeout period THEN the Authentication System SHALL invalidate the session and require re-authentication

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to log out of my account, so that I can securely end my session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the logout button THEN the Authentication System SHALL terminate the user session and clear authentication data
2. WHEN a user logs out THEN the Authentication System SHALL redirect the user to the login page
3. WHEN a logged-out user attempts to access protected pages THEN the Authentication System SHALL redirect them to the login page

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to create and manage user roles with specific permissions, so that I can control what different users can do in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin user creates a new role with a name and permission set THEN the Authentication System SHALL store the role with the specified permissions
2. WHEN an admin user assigns a role to a user THEN the Authentication System SHALL associate the role permissions with that user account
3. WHEN an admin user removes a role from a user THEN the Authentication System SHALL revoke the associated permissions from that user account
4. WHEN an admin user modifies a role's permissions THEN the Authentication System SHALL update the permissions for all users assigned to that role
5. WHEN a non-admin user attempts to manage roles THEN the Authentication System SHALL deny access and return an authorization error

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to assign specific permissions to individual users, so that I can grant custom access beyond their role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin user assigns a permission to a user THEN the Authentication System SHALL add the permission to the user's permission set
2. WHEN an admin user revokes a permission from a user THEN the Authentication System SHALL remove the permission from the user's permission set
3. WHEN checking user permissions THEN the Authentication System SHALL combine both role-based and user-specific permissions
4. WHEN a user has a permission from multiple sources THEN the Authentication System SHALL grant access based on any valid permission source

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system, I want to enforce permission checks on protected operations, so that only authorized users can perform sensitive actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to access a protected view THEN the Authentication System SHALL verify the user has the required permission before allowing access
2. WHEN a user lacks the required permission THEN the Authentication System SHALL deny access and return a 403 Forbidden response
3. WHEN an unauthenticated user attempts to access a protected view THEN the Authentication System SHALL redirect to the login page
4. WHEN checking permissions for an operation THEN the Authentication System SHALL evaluate both role-based and user-specific permissions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to view and manage all user accounts, so that I can maintain the user base and handle account issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin user requests the user list THEN the Authentication System SHALL display all user accounts with their roles and status
2. WHEN an admin user deactivates a user account THEN the Authentication System SHALL prevent that user from logging in
3. WHEN an admin user reactivates a user account THEN the Authentication System SHALL restore login access for that user
4. WHEN an admin user updates user information THEN the Authentication System SHALL save the changes and maintain data integrity
5. WHEN a non-admin user attempts to access user management THEN the Authentication System SHALL deny access and return an authorization error

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to reset my password if I forget it, so that I can regain access to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a password reset THEN the Authentication System SHALL send a password reset link to the user's registered email
2. WHEN a user clicks a valid reset link THEN the Authentication System SHALL display a password reset form
3. WHEN a user submits a new password through the reset form THEN the Authentication System SHALL update the password and invalidate the reset link
4. WHEN a user attempts to use an expired reset link THEN the Authentication System SHALL reject the request and display an error message
5. WHEN a password reset is completed THEN the Authentication System SHALL invalidate all existing sessions for that user
